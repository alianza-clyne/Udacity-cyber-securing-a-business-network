# Udacity Cybersecurity Course #1 Project - Securing a business network for Joe's Auto

## Learning Objectives:
- Explain security fundamentals including core security principles, critical security controls, and cybersecurity best practices.
- Evaluate specific security techniques used to administer a system that meets industry standards and core controls
- Assess high-level risks, vulnerabilities and attack vectors of a sample system
- Explain methods for establishing and maintaining the security of a network, computing
environment, and application.


## Scenario
You have been hired to secure the PC used at your friend’s business: Joe's Auto Body. Joe provides car repair services throughout the tri-state area. He's had previous employees use it for activities un-related to work (e.g., web browsing, personal email, social media, games, etc.) and he now uses it to store his critical business information. He suspects that others may have broken into it and may be using it to transfer files across the internet. He has asked that you secure it for him according to industry best practices, so it can be once again used as a standard PC.

You will be given access to a virtual image of Joe’s Auto Body’s PC. It’s a copy of the actual computer operating system in use that will be transferred to Joe’s computer once you are done.

This template provides you with the high-level steps you’ll need to take as part of securing a typical computer system. For each step, use the virtual Windows 10 PC to answer the questions and challenges listed in this project. You’ll also need to explain how you got the answers and provide screenshots showing your work.
It’s important that you read through the entire document before securing the system and completing this report.
